## Instructions
You can download this repository and get started using our sample smart city devices. Unzip this, and under the public folder, start up index.html (running on your local development environment is fine).  Enter “*” in the add tags field, click “add tags”, and you will start getting a feed of all devices that has a tag that begins with “sc-“.  (You can also do an “inspect element”, “console” tab from Chrome to everything).

Through this, you are essentially subscribing to all the devices that are public, have the tag beginning with “sc-“, and any other parameters you add.
