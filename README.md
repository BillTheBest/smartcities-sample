Unzip this, and under the public folder, start up index.html (running on your local development environment is fine).  Enter “*” in the add tags field, click “add tags”, and you will start getting a feed of all devices that has a tag that begins with “sc-“.  (You can also do an “inspect element”, “console” tab from Chrome to everything).
